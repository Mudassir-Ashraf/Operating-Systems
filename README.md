# Operating-Systems
This repository showcases work from a course on operating systems, covering essential concepts such as process management, scheduling, inter-process communication, and
synchronization, as well as issues like process starvation and deadlocks. The course also delves into memory management, virtual memory, and file systems, highlighting
both hardware and software features crucial for operating system functionality. The major laboratory project involves developing operating system modules, providing
hands-on experience with key operating system components and their implementation.
